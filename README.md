# Federated Theta Agent (FedML Clinical Simulation)

This project demonstrates how to build a **federated learning agent** for decentralized clinical research using **FedML**. It simulates a small synthetic clinical dataset, distributes it across clients, and runs **federated training** using FedMLâ€™s client/server orchestration. The design mimics how this would run on a decentralized infrastructure like **Theta Cloud + Edge**.

---

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Synthetic Clinical Dataset**
  - Features: age, systolic/diastolic blood pressure, glucose, comorbidity, lab marker.
  - Binary classification task (risk prediction).
- **Non-IID Client Data Split**
  - Data is distributed across clients to simulate real-world hospital settings.
- **Federated Training via FedML**
  - Uses FedMLâ€™s `FedMLRunner` to coordinate server + clients.
  - Clients train locally with a simple MLP classifier.
  - Server aggregates updates using FedAvg.
- **Local Test Launcher**
  - Spawns one server + multiple client processes on the same machine for quick testing.

# DEZI NETWORK

## Decentralised Clinical Research Framework 

**Key Components:**

- **Blockchain Infrastructure:** Solana Blockchain with advanced advanced privacy features which use zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and homomorphic encryption to shield sensitive data (patient information) while maintaining regulatory compliance and auditability.
- **Federated Learning Integration:** Clinical research frameworks can leverage federated learning, allowing institutions to collaboratively train AI models without sharing raw patient data. Only encrypted model updates are posted to the blockchain, preserving privacy and adhering to regulations like GDPR.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** zk-SNARKs enable verification of computations or model updates on-chain without revealing underlying sensitive data, ensuring both privacy and data integrity.
- **Decentralized Access Control:** Solanaâ€™s privacy tools and protocols like Arcium and Lit enable fine-grained, programmable access controls and encrypted computation, so only authorized parties can access or process clinical data.

**Summary Table**

| Feature                        | Solana Implementation                        | Benefit for Clinical Research      |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Confidential Balances          | ZKPs + Homomorphic Encryption                | Private, compliant data sharing   |
| Federated Learning             | Decentralized model training, blockchain logs| No raw data leaves institution    |
| zk-SNARKs                      | On-chain proof of computation                | Verifiable, privacy-preserving    |

**Existing Frameworks**

There are privacy-preserving decentralized clinical research frameworks, primarily leveraging blockchain technology. Most existing solutions use private or consortium blockchains (like Hyperledger Fabric or Ethereum) to manage clinical trial data, automate consent, and control access via smart contracts[1][5][6]. These frameworks focus on data security, transparency, and auditability, often storing sensitive data off-chain or encrypted, and using decentralized storage systems like IPFS[1][6]. While many are still proof-of-concept or pilot projects, they demonstrate the feasibility of privacy-preserving, decentralized clinical research management[1][6][7].
