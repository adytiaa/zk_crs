# Zero-Knowledge Federated Learning

This project demonstrates decentralized federated learning with privacy guarantees using zero-knowledge proofs.

## Flow
1. Local model training at hospitals.
2. ZK proofs for access, training of models, and correct execution.
3. Proof verification on Solana.
4. DAO rewards participants.
5. Global model aggregation.
